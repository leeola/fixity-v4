# Fixity (unstable)

_fixity: the quality of being incapable of mutation; immutability_

Fixity is an experimental immutable personal data store.

This is a highly experimental pet project. API and Json formats are not
yet final.


## Project Goals

With massive inspiration from [Perkeep](https://perkeep.org),
Fixity aims to be:

- Low maintenance, small in scope.
- Versioned and content addressable.
- An embeddable database "for your life".
- Syncable with safety and confidence _(content addressable)_.


## Why not Perkeep _(n√©e Camlistore)_?

There are no reasons, you should use Perkeep.


## Why write this then?

Experimentation and flexibility, primarily. I want the ability
to control drastic changes to the underlying system and design.
For example, being a small embeddable database is important
to me and the design will reflect that.

With that said, as time goes on there may be a small differences
in this project that give it merit. Only time will tell.

For now, your data is important. Use Perkeep.

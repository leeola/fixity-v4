# Fixity (unstable)

_fixity: the quality of being incapable of mutation; immutability_

Fixity is an experimental immutable personal data store.

This is a highly experimental pet project. API and Json formats are not
yet final.


## Project Goals

With much inspiration from [Perkeep](https://perkeep.org),
Fixity aims to be:

- Low maintenance, small in scope.
- Easily sync files between computers.
- Versioned and content addressable.
- An embeddable database "for your life"


## Why not Perkeep _(n√©e Camlistore)_?

None, you should use Perkeep. As far as why i develop Fixity?
Experimentation and and flexibility, primarily. I want the ability
to control drastic changes to the underlying system and design.
As this project has done, many times prior.

With that said, as time goes on there may be a small differences
in this project that give it merit. Only time will tell.
